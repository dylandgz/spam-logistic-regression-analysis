# Logistic Regression Analysis

Logistic Regression analysis and testing. This project offers a comprehensive exploration and assessment of the dataset's characteristics using the power of Logistic Regression.

## Overview

In this repository, we dive into the world of spam email classification. We begin by loading and inspecting the dataset, understanding its dimensions, and visualizing class distribution. With a solid understanding of the data, we move on to training a Logistic Regression model to predict spam emails.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Gain insights into the dataset by examining its contents, basic statistics, and visualizing the distribution of spam and non-spam instances.

2. **Model Training**: Utilize the Logistic Regression algorithm to train a model on the provided data, setting the stage for predictive power.

3. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate the model's performance using key metrics such as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, Precision-Recall curve, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). This step provides insights into the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

4. **Test and Validate**: Put the model to the test on unseen data and assess its precision, recall, and F1 score. This step provides a realistic view of the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
